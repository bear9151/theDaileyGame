# theDaileyGame

Welcome to the Dailey Game!

Each day, there's a new Dailey category--the object is to lock in a word that works with the category!

To begin, press START. The letter roulette starts to change. Hit the STOP button to grab each letter to form your word.

Watch out! After each letter, the roulette goes faster and faster!

When you've finished your word and ready to submit for the day, hit the LOCK button for your word to be stored. The more uncommon letters you use, the higher your score!

Be quick! Every play is timed--which means the faster you can lock in a word, the more points you'll get! (not yet in production)
